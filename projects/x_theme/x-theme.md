# Overview
X-Theme allows users to interactively play two types of musical instruments: (a) piano and (b) mixed percussion. By default, the application is set to piano. Users can easily switch between instruments using the interface buttons.

# Features
Upon launching the application, the user interface presents three buttons that allow users to:

1. Select Instruments : Toggle between the piano and mixed percussion.
2. Instrument Location : Position the instrument interface at the top or bottom of the screen.
3. Volume Control : Adjust the system's volume.

# Paino Feature
The virtual piano is crafted using OpenCV, enabling users to play notes through a graphical interface that simulates a piano keyboard.
